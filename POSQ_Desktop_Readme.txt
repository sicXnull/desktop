To install the POSQ Desktop app:
Ensure that all operating system permissions are granted during the install process.

Also, ensure that any antivirus or firewall permissions are granted during the install process.

The program could take up to 15 minutes or possibly a bit more to fully sync with the blockchain after first installing.

You will know the install is completed after you see the Wallet is Syncing screen appear and then disappear.

At that point, you should see the version information for both Client and Daemon showing in the lower left of the POSQ Desktop app screen.

You should also see the words "FULLY SYNCED" in the lower left area of the app screen.

You may want to wait for a bit until you do not see the message "syncing with network"

At that point your wallet should be ready for use.

NOTE: You are responsible for your wallet.  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

We will do everything we can to protect the wallet.dat, but there are many situations where the app cannot protect you from losing your wallet.
